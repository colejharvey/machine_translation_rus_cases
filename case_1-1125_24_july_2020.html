S., accused Bragin A.M., Burkevic A.A., of their defence lawyers of Semenova N.A., Kolesnikov E.Y., under the custody of the Registrar, reviewed in open court the decision of the Russian SKS investigator of the Kurgan Region of Dimova N.M. to bring before the court an application for the dismissal of the criminal case and to prosecute and impose criminal measures of a criminal nature in the form of a court fine against an accused person charged with an offence under paragraph 2 (a) of article 2 of the Criminal Code. 141. The Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, Burkevitz Alexei Alexandrovich, born of an innocent person accused of committing an offence under paragraph (a), paragraph 2 (c). 141. The Criminal Code of the Russian Federation decided that: DD.MMM. GHHG, during the period from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m., Bragin and Burkevitz, who were intoxicated in the yard, deliberately by a group of persons on prior conspiracy, aware that FIO13 and FIO14 were members of the electoral commission and were in the performance of their duties to conduct an off-site general vote on the approval of changes to the Constitution of the Russian Federation, in the presence of an FIO15 observer and the tenants of the house, expressed their negative attitude towards it and, in an aggressive manner, demanded that the members of the electoral commission cease their duties, and unlawfully accused them of their illegal activities to campaign for the approval of changes to the Constitution of the Russian Federation, thereby creating conditions preventing the members of the electoral commission from carrying out their voting duties outside the premises, and consequently, FIO14 and FIO13 left the court of the said house and proceeded to the No. on the opposite side of the same house, continuing to perform their duties. Bragin and Burkewitz followed them, where Bragin, acting in a group and in collusion with Burkewitz, seized a portable voting box in the hand of the FIO14 with the ballot papers it contained, pushed the FIO15 to the FIO14 and the FIO13 to cause them physical pain, causing them to fall and the portable box to fall out of the hand of the FIO14 while the drawer was damaged and rendered unusable for voting, after which Bragin ripped out of the hand of the FIO14 the bag with the personal protection of her hands. In the meantime, Burkewitz, acting in a group and in collusion with Bragin, pushed FIO 15 hands behind his back, inflicting physical pain on him, holding him in such a position until Bragin had completed his action to stop voting. Thus, Bragin and Burkewitz committed the offence provided for in paragraph (a), paragraph 2 (c). 141 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation - obstruction of the exercise of electoral rights or the work of electoral commissions, i.e. obstruction of the activities of an electoral commission member related to the performance of his or her duties, connected with the use of violence, committed by a group of persons by prior conspiracy. The investigator applied to the court for the dismissal of the criminal case against Bragin and Burkevic and for the criminal prosecution of a criminal measure in the form of a judicial fine, stating that they had made full reparation for the damage and had made good the damage they had done for the first time in a medium offence. The accused Bragin and Burkewitz, in a court hearing, agreed with the charge against each of them, explaining that they understood its substance and fully recognized the guilt of the crime, supported the investigator &apos; s request and agreed to discontinue the criminal case against each of them and to release them from criminal responsibility with the imposition of a fine on each of them under article 25.1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, article 76.2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. explaining what they understand, and they are aware of the consequences of the termination of the case on this basis, which is not a rehabilitation ground. Counsel indicated that criminal proceedings could be discontinued against Bragin and Burkewitz under article 76.2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. And the D.A. didn't object to it. Having heard the views of the parties to the proceedings and having examined the criminal case file, I draw the following conclusions. 76.2 A person who has first committed a moderate offence may be released from criminal liability by a court with a court fine if he or she has compensated the damage or otherwise compensated the damage caused by the crime. 25.1 The court, on the basis of the outcome of the examination of the application submitted by the investigator with the consent of the head of the investigative body, shall, in the cases provided for in article 14, paragraph 1, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, decide whether or not to proceed with the examination of the application submitted by the investigator with the consent of the head of the investigating body. 76.2 The Criminal Code of the Russian Federation has the right to discontinue criminal proceedings or criminal proceedings against a person accused of a medium offence if that person has compensated for the damage or otherwise compensated the harm caused by the crime and to impose a measure of a criminal law nature on the person in the form of a judicial fine; It is established in the court hearing that the accused understand and accept in full the charge against each of them, agree to the termination of the criminal case against them and to release each of them from criminal responsibility with the imposition of a judicial fine under article 25.1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 76.2 The Criminal Code, after explaining what they understand, is aware of the consequences of the dismissal of the case on this basis, which is not a rehabilitation measure. The court hearing found that Bragin and Burkewitz were charged for the first time with a medium offence, characterized positively by work and residence, compensated for the damage caused by the crime by apologizing to the victims and transferring money. Having examined the criminal case file, I conclude that the charges against Bragin and Burkewitz for the offence under paragraph (a), paragraph 2 (c), of the Criminal Code were brought against them. 141 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation are substantiated and supported by evidence gathered in a criminal case. The court hearing found that Bragin and Burkewitz had been charged for the first time with a medium offence, had a positive character, had compensated for the damage caused by the crime by way of financial compensation and had apologized to the victims. In view of these circumstances, which show that there are all the legal grounds for the dismissal of the criminal case against Bragin and Burkewitz and for the exemption of them from criminal liability, and for the imposition of each fine in accordance with the provisions of article 14. 76.2 The Criminal Code, taking into account the circumstances of the case, the nature and degree of the public danger involved, as well as the identity of the accused, finds it possible to release Bragin and Burkevic from criminal responsibility and to discontinue criminal proceedings against them on the grounds and in accordance with the procedure provided for in article 14. 76.2 The Criminal Code, with the imposition of a measure of a criminal law nature in the form of a judicial fine, the application of which is fair and sufficient to achieve the objectives of the criminal law, including the prevention of the commission of new offences. In determining the amount of the judicial fine to Bragin and Burkewitz under art. 104.5 The Criminal Code takes into account the degree of social danger of the crime committed, the identity of the accused and their property situation and the existence of a permanent source of income. The preventive measures chosen by the accused in the form of house arrest should be lifted, since there were no grounds for their continued application. On the basis of the above, in accordance with art. 25.1, 29, 446.2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation, decided that the request of the investigator of the UK Security Council in the Kurgan region of Dimova N.M. should be satisfactory.
